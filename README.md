# Implementation-of-a-Parameterized-Multiplier-using-Carry-Look-Ahead-Adder
The objective of the project is to implement a multiplier using carry look-ahead (CLA) adder, with parameterized input. Our module can multiply two numbers of n-bits with the use of CLA adder. In the project, the layout for the parameterized CLA multiplier is also implemented using Cadence Genus and Cadence Innovus.

# Contents
The repository contains the following files.
* Main Code.v - The main Verilog code, implements bothe the CLA adder and multiplier function
* Testbench.v - A simple testbench for the module
* CLA_Multiplier_view - The MMMC definition file required for layout design using Cadence Innovus
* CLA_floorplan.tcl - .tcl file for the floorplan of the CLA Multiplier layout
