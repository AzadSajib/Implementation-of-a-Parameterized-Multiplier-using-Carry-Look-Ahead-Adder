# Implementation-of-a-Parameterized-Multiplier-using-Carry-Look-Ahead-Adder
The objective of the project is to implement a multiplier using carry look-ahead (CLA) adder, with parameterized input. Our module can multiply two numbers of n-bits with the use of CLA adder. In the project, the layout for the parameterized CLA multiplier is also implemented using Cadence Genus and Cadence Innovus.
